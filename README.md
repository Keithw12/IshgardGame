# Tombstone Rising

## Story

As a veteran of the Mexican-American War, Thomas Stone became disillusioned with the death and destruction he witnessed. To escape his demons, he retired to the isolated frontier town of Tombstone, wherehe spent his days chasing off coyotes and giving the bartender a reason to stay in business. One bazing summer day, a series of temors shook Thomas out of his drunken stupor. At the urging of the townspeople, Thomas ventured into the mine, only to find an ancient sword, which seemed to be the source of the mysterious emenations. Eager to get back to his daily bottle of cheap alcohol, he attempted to wretch the sword loose, only to be knocked out by a blinding flash of light. He wakes up after what feels like days to discover that the sword is now fused to his hands. After stumbling back to town, he cries out for help, only to discover that the townspeople have been transformed into grotesque, rotting skeletons hell bent on consuming him and taking the sword back. Now Thomas must cut down those he once called friends if he hopes to survive and eventually break this curse.
